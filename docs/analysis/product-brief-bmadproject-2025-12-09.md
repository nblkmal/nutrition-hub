# Product Brief: bmadproject

## Executive Summary

**bmadproject** is a nutrition guidance tool designed to solve the fundamental information gap that prevents active individuals from achieving their fitness goals. Unlike complex nutrition tracking apps, we provide immediate, actionable meal plans through a simple 2-minute guided walkthrough, targeting gym practitioners and beginners who need clear "what to eat today" answers without the complexity of food logging or ongoing tracking.

The product addresses a critical market failure: most nutrition resources provide abstract guidelines (e.g., "eat 150g protein daily") without concrete examples of how to implement those recommendations in real meals. By combining visual-first design with personalized daily meal plans, we make nutrition accessible and actionable for everyone.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Active individuals, particularly gym-goers (4-5 days per week), face significant barriers to achieving their fitness goals due to confusion around nutrition. Current resources either provide abstract guidelines without practical implementation examples or require complex, feature-heavy applications that overwhelm beginners. This creates a knowledge gap where motivated individuals cannot translate nutritional science into daily eating habits.

### Problem Impact

- Beginners abandon fitness goals due to nutrition confusion
- Gym practitioners struggle to optimize their muscle building or weight loss results
- People waste time searching conflicting information sources
- Motivation decreases when nutrition guidance feels overwhelming or inaccessible
- Fitness progress stalls due to improper meal planning and nutrient timing

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Information Gap:** Websites and apps provide abstract numbers without meal examples
- **Complexity Barrier:** Tools like MyFitnessPal require extensive setup and ongoing logging
- **Overwhelming Features:** Most nutrition apps include unnecessary features for beginners
- **Lack of Personalization:** Generic meal plans don't account for individual goals and preferences
- **Visual Overload:** Text-heavy interfaces intimidate users seeking simple guidance

### Proposed Solution

A visual-first nutrition guidance tool featuring:

1. **Simple Icon-Based Walkthrough:** 5-6 tap questions with intuitive icons (💪 muscle building, ⚖️ weight loss)
2. **Personalized Daily Meal Plans:** Complete day examples tailored to user goals and preferences
3. **"What Should I Eat Today?" Feature:** Quick-hit meal suggestions for returning users
3. **No Logging Required:** Focus on information delivery, not ongoing tracking
4. **MVP Approach:** Start with core guidance functionality, expand to tracking features later

### Key Differentiators

- **Simplicity First:** 2-minute user journey from goal to actionable meal plan
- **Practical Examples:** Every recommendation includes concrete meal examples
- **Visual-First Design:** Icons and visual cues over text-heavy interfaces
- **Targeted Focus:** Built by gym practitioners for the active community
- **No Commitment Required:** Users can get value without ongoing app usage
